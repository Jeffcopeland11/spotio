# Spotio for Spotify.app

### **[HELP NEEDED](http://github.com/devinhalladay/spotio/issues)**

![Spotio screenshot](screenshot.png)

**If you decided to go with Spotify after Rdio was bought but, like me, you miss Rdio's light UI, you're in luckâ€”I discovered that you can skin the Spotify app with CSS.**

*Disclaimer: I have nothing but respect for the Spotify design and engineering teams, and undertaking this project has served only to increase that respect. They're really, really brilliant teams doing things that I admire greatly. I appreciate the design decisions they made while designing the app, but I prefer a light theme in my apps, so this project is merely an attempt to cater to my love of Rdio, not to do it "better" than the Spotify team did.*

# Download
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you allow opening applications from anywhere in your Mac's Security preferences, otherwise this app will ***not*** work.

**Make sure you quit (cmd + q) your local Spotify.app before launching my version, otherwise my version won't launch.**

# To-do
- [ ] Add a Grunt task to setup the local repo for people who have just cloned this repo for development.
- [ ] Add documentation guide for contributing to this repo.
- [ ] Design new icons for the app for `v1.1` public release.
- [x] **HIGH PRIORITY:** Figure out how to get access to the rendered DOM from Chromium Embedded Framework so I can fully style all elements.
- [x] Streaming build system so I don't need to keep rebuilding and recompiling every single Sass file when I make a single change.

# Development
Originally, I used bash scripts to manage development for this app, but I switched to a streaming build system using Grunt.

## Grunt Tasks
- `sudo grunt`: Build all CSS and watch for changes
- `sudo grunt clean:spa`: Deletes all `.spa` files from .tmp/Spotify.app
- `sudo grunt clean:oldApps`: Deletes old apps in .tmp
- `sudo grunt download`: Downloads latest spotify binary and places it in .tmp/
- `sudo grunt shell:extract`: Extracts the most recently downloaded Spotify.app from .tmp/Spotify.dmg
- `sudo grunt compress`: Compress your Spotify.app into a distributable .zip
- `sudo grunt copy:icon`: Copies the custom icon into dist/Spotify.app
